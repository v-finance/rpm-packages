Prerequisites
=============

Packages for building RPMs (rpm-build, rpm-devel, rpmlint and rpmdevtools)
should already be installed on your workstation by ansible.


Building Packages
=================

A list of the available packages can be obtained using:

$ invoke list-packages

When building a package for the first time, it is necessary to install the build
dependencies:

$ invoke install-build-deps <package>

Next, the package can be build:

$ invoke build-package <package>


Package Specific Options
========================

Some spec files provide additional configuration options. These are explained in
the section at the top of the spec file.

For example, the python3 package allows for a suffix to be used:

$ VORTEX_PYTHON_SUFFIX=-feature-freeze invoke build-package vortex-python3

This will add the provided suffix to both the package name and install directory.
